# Process for Adding Package Managers

Date: 2025-07-18

## Context

Hermeto is intended to support a wide range of programming languages and
dependency management systems. Now that we have a "critical mass" of package
managers, the project should codify the requirements Hermeto needs to support a
given package manager, and the "lifecycle" for evolving a package manager.

The phases of the lifecycle are inspired by our experiences with [DNF][] and
[Maven][], which currently do not have mature mechanisms for declaring and
pinning dependencies.

## Decision

### Candidates for Package Manager Support

Hermeto can support *any* package manager that is able to generate a
comprehensive list of uniqely identified dependencies, and has a process for
persisting these dependencies locally to disk. The dependency list does not have
to include a set of expected checksums for each item, however this practice is
**strongly encouraged**. The dependecy list must include

- Direct dependencies of the artifact to be built
- Indirect (transitive) dependencies of the artifact
- Dependencies required for compilation that are external to the package
  manager. For example, Maven plugins. Indirect/transitive dependencies of these
  compilation tools/packages must also be identified

Hermeto is **not** responsible for generating or validating this dependency list.

### Contribution and Promotion Process

The Hermeto project will use a phased approach for accepting new package
managers. The "lifecycle" of a package manager can be broken down into the
following phases

1. Proposal
2. Experimental
3. Incubating
4. Graduated

#### Proposal Phase

In the "proposal" phase, the candidate package manager is evaluated for project
fit and feasibility. Those who wish to add a new package manager should submit
an ADR describing the package manager and the high-level process developers
should use to generate the dependency list.

Maintainers at this stage should evaluate the following

   1. Can a developer generate a dependency list? Even an incomplete one?
   2. What is the value to the community? Is the package manager worth maintaining?

Part of Hermeto's mission is to encourage software supply chain best practices
in the software development lifecycle. Therefore maintainers should **not**
consider limitations on how the dependency list is generated at this phase.
Procedures that rely on proof of concept tools that have not been adopted
"upstream" are fine.

Package managers graduate to "Experimental" when the ADR is approved and merged.

#### Experimental Phase

During the experimental phase, the new package manager is added to the
[_dev_package_managers][] list. This disables the package manager by default.
Contributors begin implementing the package manager by creating a new module
within `hermeto.core.package_managers`, then declaring a main `fetch_*` function
that obtains the package manager's dependencies.

Experimental package managers do not need to work end to end, or have complete
functionality. They *should* warn users that the package manager is experimental
and not guaranteed to produce a successful hermetic build.

As the experimental package manager is iterated on, key technical decisions
should be captured in a corresponding document in the `docs/design` folder. The
document should eventually include the following

- Background context of the package manager - how it works, the typical "day in
  the life" of a developer
- Procedure for generating the dependency list and/or checksum file(s). Links to
  external tools should be provided if the package manager does not natively
  support the generation of such files
- Links to technical requirements/specifications if Hermeto needs to download
  files to a specific directory tree structure, or supply other metadata
- Environment variables that need to be set so the package manager utilizes the
  files downloaded by Hermeto
- Configuration files that need to be updated or generated so that the package
  manager builds with the dependencies pinned by Hermeto

Package managers graduate to "Incubating" when the following criteria are satisfied

- The package manager fully implements the pre-fetch process

  - Downloads dependencies in a structure the package manager understands
  - Sets environment variables so that the package manager utilizes Hermeto's pre-fetched
    dependencies
  - Generates or updates configuration files so that the packagqe manager builds
    with Hermeto's pre- fetched dependencies

- Maintainers are satisfied with the design document details
- Demonstration of a proof of concept hermetic build for the package manager
  The PoC does not need to use a "real" project - a "hello world" project with
  minimal dependencies is sufficient

#### Incubating Phase

During the incubating phase, the package manager should still be disabled by
default, but does not need to emit any "experimental" warnings. The Hermeto
community should seek feedback from the package manager's community regarding
the process and demonstrate hermetic builds with increasing levels of project
complexity.

Incubating package managers should use this phase to draft end user
documentation (under the `docs/` directory). Documentation should instruct end
users how to generate the dependency list and execute a hermetic build with
Hermeto. These procedures can reference external tools that are proof of concept
or otherwise not fully supported by the package manager's community. If such a
tool is utilized, the documentation should indicate these procedures are subject
to change at any time.

Incubating package managers are allowed to make breaking changes. If a breaking
change is introduced, it should be documented in a release note.

Incubating package managers are promoted to "Graduated" when the Hermeto
community agrees the following criteria are satisfied

1. The process for generating the dependency list is supported by the underlying
   package manager's community - either directly or through a well-maintained
   external party tool
2. A developer with reasonable package manager experience can use Hermeto to
   pre-fetch dependencies by reading the project documentation
3. A sufficient number of demonstration/pilot projects have been able to use
   Hermeto to execute a hermetic build with the package manager

#### Graduated Phase

Graduated package managers are moved from the `_dev_package_managers` set to the
full set of supported package managers. At this point the package manager is
enabled by default and suitable for general use.

Graduated package managers can only be removed with a major version update to
Hermeto (ex: v1 to v2). User-facing details such as configuration values/flags
can be deprecated and rendered non- functional with a minor version update, but
cannot be removed without a major version update. Any deprecation must include a
release note announcing the change.

## Consequences

- Contribution guidelines will need to be updated to codify the
  process/lifecycle in this ADR, including

  - Iterative design documentation alongside code changes
  - Documentation requirements for promoting/graduating package managers

- Our current support for RPM/DNF should be documented (technical designs and
  end-user procedures)
- The Hermeto project should create a design document template used when
  contributors add (and iterate on) package manager support
- Hermeto's release notes process must be able to announce deprecations and removals
